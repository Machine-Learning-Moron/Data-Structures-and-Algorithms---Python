'''
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.
Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= 109

class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums, k):
        cnt, ans = Counter(nums), 0
        for val in cnt:
            ans += min(cnt[val], cnt[k - val])
        return ans//2
